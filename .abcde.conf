# Use cdparanoia for ripping. The -B option runs it in "batch" mode,
# which is perfect for scripting. It still performs full paranoia checks.

#CDPARANOIAOPTS="-B"

# Set options for the FLAC encoder.
# -V: Verify the encoded file against the original.
# --best or -8: Use the highest compression level (smallest file, still lossless).
# -T "ARTIST=${ARTIST}" etc.: These options pass metadata for tagging.
# abcde handles this automatically, but you could add more if needed.
